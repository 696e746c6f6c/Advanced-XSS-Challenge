# Advanced-XSS-Challenge

## Description: 

- This is a Advanced XSS challenge that I've created. All you need to do is to pop up a Reflected XSS issue. 

## Usage:

- If you want to access URL of this challenge. Here's what you can do. Open your terminal and type this:

`sudo apt-get install apache2`

`sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/*`

`sudo cp -r ~/path/src/* /var/www/html/`

`sudo service apache2 start`

`sudo ufw allow 80/tcp`

- Also if you want to verify that your Apache server is running, you can do this via this command:

`sudo service apache2 status`

## Warning:

- Please if there's any issues with my code or it's not possible to solve this challenge, feel free to open issues and I will check them. But I'm prety sure it's possible to solve this challenge. You will see why.

## Note:

- If you get one, contact me on Twitter or send me a screenshot to my HackerOne email. Hope you enjoy it and good luck!
